# week-13-e-commerce-site-back-end

## Project Description

This is a back end for an e-commerce site built with a working Express.js API to utilize Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. In this project, starter code was given, which had to be modified in order for it to work and to meet the below acceptance criteria. A walkthrough video was also made demonstrating its functionality and showing the acceptance criteria being met

WHEN One adds his/her database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN One is able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN One enters schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN One enters the command to invoke the application
THEN One's server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
